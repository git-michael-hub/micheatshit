        <br>
        <p>Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.</p>
        <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.</p>
        <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <code-example code="
        sass input.scss output.css
        "></code-example>
        <br>
        <p>You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass.</p>
        <code-example code="
        sass --watch input.scss output.css
        "></code-example>

        <br>
        <p>You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. </p>
        <code-example code="
        sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
        "></code-example>
        <br>
        <p>Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.</p>
