        <h1>Partials</h1>
        <br>
        <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. </p>
        <p>A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like <code>_partial.scss</code>. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.</p>
