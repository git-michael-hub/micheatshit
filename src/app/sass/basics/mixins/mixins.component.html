        <h1>Mixins</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.</p>

        <h3>SCSS</h3>
        <code-example code="

        <p>To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin theme. We're also using the variable $theme inside the parentheses so we can pass in a theme of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin.</p>
