        <h3>Revising your last commit</h3>
        <p><code>git commit --amend</code> allows us to make changes to the commit that HEAD is currently pointing to. Two of the most common uses are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Re-writing commit messages</li>
            <li>Adding files to the commit</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Let's see this in action:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new file:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bash: <code>touch file7.md</code></li>
                    <li>PowerShell: <code>Out-File file7.md</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you are adding files to the previous commit, they should be in the staging area. Move your file to the staging area: <code>git add file7.md</code></li>
            <li><code>git commit --amend</code></li>
            <li>The text editor will open, allowing you to edit your commit message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">You can actually amend any data stored by the last commit such as commit author, email, etc.</p>
